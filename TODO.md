# Server Upgrade and UI Improvement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Node.js server (port 3000) handles static files, auth (JWT-based), and chat message saving to MongoDB.
- Python FastAPI server (port 8000) handles Google OAuth and chatbot responses.
- Frontend uses localStorage for chat history but sends messages to Node.js server with placeholder bot responses.
- Auth tokens are stored in localStorage but lack validation/refresh.
- Chat history is not loaded from server; UI relies on localStorage.
- CORS is configured, but error handling and UI responsiveness need improvement.

## Plan
- [x] Improve error handling and validation in authcontroller.js and chatController.js.
- [x] Update chatController.js to properly load chat history from MongoDB.
- [x] Integrate frontend script.js with Python chatbot for real AI responses.
- [x] Add JWT token validation and refresh logic in frontend.
- [x] Enhance UI responsiveness with loading states and error messages.
- [x] Ensure proper CORS, security headers, and server robustness.
